# ðŸ¤–Arduino: Introduction to Microcontrollers and ProgrammingðŸ¤–

## What is Arduino?
> Arduino is a development platform based on a free hardware electronic board that incorporates a re-programmable microcontroller and a series of female pins,
> which allow connections to be established between the microcontroller and different sensors and actuators in a very simple way.
> The Institute of Interactive Design of Ivrea (Italy) was born in 2005 due to the need to have a low-cost device to use in classrooms.

## Why use Arduino?
> It is free and extensible. It uses a cross-platform programming environment so it can be installed and run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux operating systems.
> Easy to understand programming language based on C++. It allows easy entry for new programmers and at the same time with such great capacity that the most advanced programmers
> can squeeze the full potential of their language and adapt it to any situation. Low cost.
> Arduino UNO is low cost, and since it is free hardware it could even be built.
> Re-usability and versatility. It is re-usable because once the project is finished it is very easy to disassemble the components external to the board and start > with a new project.

## The Arduino board
> The program will be implemented using Arduino's own programming environment and will be transferred using a USB cable.
> Although in the case of the USB board it is not necessary to use an external power supply, since the USB cable itself provides it,
> to carry out some of the practical experiments it will be necessary to have an external power supply since the power provided by USB may not be sufficient.


## Development environment
> To program the board it is necessary to download the development environment (IDE) from the Arduino website.
> Versions are available for Windows and MAC, as well as the sources to compile them in LINUX.
> Figure 2 shows what the programming environment looks like. If you have a USB board, it is necessary to install the FTDI drivers.
> These drivers are included in the Arduino package mentioned above. There are versions on the web for different operating systems.
